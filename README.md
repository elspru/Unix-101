# Unix 101.

We'll be covering these topics:
 - Why people use the shell ðŸ¤”
 - Basics of shell interaction 
   - `Less`, basic editing like `nano` maybe?, `cd`, file system, running programs
 - Some fun commands
   - How to install new programs (Mac / Linux) :hammer_and_wrench:
 - Writing a simple script :writ
 - Background tasks (?)
 - `ssh`
 - Further learning! Ssh, git, scp, tmux
 

## Why people use the shell
The shell (also called terminal, or command line) is really powerful, a lot more powerful that programs with GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces).
Lots of programs only really work for the command line, and almost every software professional (ðŸ’°) knows their way around it.

## Basics of shell interaction


### Opening the terminal
Linux :penguin:: On Ubuntu, Ctrl+Alt+T will open a Terminal. Otherwise, this might depend on your Linux distribution.

MacOS :apple:: Open up the application called Terminal. In the future, if you start to use the terminal more, you may want to isntall [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), as it's much more powerful and nicer.

### First things
When you open the terminal, you will be greeted with what's called the **prompt**. This is where you enter commands.

`username@machine-name:your-working-path`

If you run a Linux distribution, and you are only using the GUI, you are missing out. The Linux terminal is an extremely powerful tool that goes well beyond the GUI. Writing commands might seem scary for a beginner, but you will soon get the hang of it. In this guide, you will find the most important Linux commands, to use the terminal like a pro.


We have prepared this guide on Linux Mint 18.1 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

The basic Linux commands, however, are universal, and they should work on any past and future distribution. They will even work with non-Linux operating systems based on Unix, such as FreeBSD, or the macOS / OS X terminal.
